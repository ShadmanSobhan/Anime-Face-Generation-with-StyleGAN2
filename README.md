# Anime-Face-Generation-with-StyleGAN2
This repository contains resources to train a Style GAN2 model for Animated face Generation.

The main notebook was executed on Kaggle and as the maximum runtime of a session is 12 hrs, we could run approximately 30-35 epochs as each epoch requires 20 min 51s.

Base code was taken from [Anime Generation GitHub Repo](https://github.com/aniruddhapal211316/anime_generation). This work is based on [Anime Faces Dataset](https://github.com/aniruddhapal211316/anime_generation)

If you don't want to do training, you can directly access the trained weights from [Trained Weights](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KTMRJ83CvS4-gy2aaekp1yDUdXy89Da7?usp=sharing)
